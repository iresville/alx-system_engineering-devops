## Issue Summary

- **Duration of the Drama**: September 19, 2023, 19:19 UTC - September 23, 2023, 20:34 UTC  
- **Impact**: Both the "Romeo" (web-01) and "Juliet" (web-02) of our servers decided to elope, leaving us in digital darkness.  
- **Root Cause**: A Shakespearean tragedy of misconfigured love letters (aka config files) and a locked castle gate (SSH lockout).

## Root Cause and Resolution: The Plot Twist

- **Root Cause**: Misconfigured files and an overzealous castle guard (SSH lockout).
- **Resolution**: New squires, new hope. Reconfigured and lived happily ever after (until the next update).

## Corrective and Preventative Measures: Lessons from the Oracle

- **Improvements/Fixes**: 
  - Always have a dress rehearsal (test configs locally).
  - Keep a spare key under the doormat (rollback strategy).

- **Tasks to Address the Issue**:
  1. Build a sandbox kingdom for testing.
  2. Engrave all changes in the Book of Configurations.
  3. Hire a court jester to monitor server health (automated checks).
