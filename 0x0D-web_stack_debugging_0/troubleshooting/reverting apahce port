Since we initially mapped port 8080 of our host machine to port 80 of the Docker container, we'll need to either:

1. Update the Docker container's port mapping to reflect the change to 8081.
2. Or revert the Apache2 port back to 80 if we want to keep the initial Docker port mapping.

### Option 1: Update Docker Container's Port Mapping
To update the Docker container's port mapping, we'll need to stop the current container and run a new one with the updated port mapping.

1. Stop the current container:
    ```bash
    docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]
    ```
2. Run a new container with updated port mapping:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8081 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
    ```

### Option 2: Revert Apache2 Port to 80
If we choose to revert the Apache2 port back to 80, we'll need to update the `ports.conf` and `000-default.conf` files inside the Docker container.

1. Connect to the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID] /bin/bash
    ```
2. Edit `ports.conf` and `000-default.conf` to set the port back to 80.
3. Restart Apache2:
    ```bash
    service apache2 restart
    ```
